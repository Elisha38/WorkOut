## Purpose of the App

This app is aimed towards users who know what exercises they want to do, to allow them to store all their exercises together. The exercises are displayed as a list for them to choose.

2) Select the newly created exercise button to navigate to the exercise screen
3) Enter the number of sets and rest time and update both fields
4) Optionally, go to settings to turn on vibrate or sound to trigger when the rest countdown finishes
5) Perform your first exercise set
6) Tap the 'Rest' button to start the rest countdown timer

  
## Possible Updates:

- when an exercise is completed, change its button to a different color (red to green?)
- reset the color of the exercise buttons to default (uncompleted exercise) color after a specific real-time 
- when an exercise in completed, move the position of its button to the bottom of the list
- user can sort the list, and save the order
